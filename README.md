### Send encrypted secure messages over a network!

Establish secure connections with your friends and send them secret messages.

This is an extension of an assignment for Computer Networking.
The original assignment, which can be see in the BobAndAlice branch, was entirely console based where Bob sent Alice a hard-coded secret message.
The connection would terminate as soon as this single message was sent.
